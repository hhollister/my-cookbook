# Heather Hollister Individual Project - Cookbook

### Problem Statement
There are apps like Pinterest that are great for finding recipes. But the problem is, what do you do with all your recipes? How do you merge all your different recipes to one area that's easily accessible? This website will allow you to create an account and keep your recipes all in one place. It will also allow you to create a meal plan to help your self plan for grocery shopping as well as creating a grocery list.
